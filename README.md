# contrast-calculator
## (UNDER PROGRESS)
Just another color contrast calculator!

## Why 

Just a quick and funny way to:
- calculate the color contrast between two colors
- preview the colors in more real life scenarios: as texts, Titles, buttons...
- take over the world

## Current state
(don't stare for too much it is hideous!!!)
